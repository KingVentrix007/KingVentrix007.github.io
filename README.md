# Welcome to my website

I am a part-time(trying for fulltime) programmer, software developer,operating system developer , and full time nerd.
I code [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) and [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Currently I am working on 4 or 5 projects, but my main focus is [AthenX-2.0](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX-2.0), my hobby operating system. 

# About me

I have been coding since 2017, since then I have worked on some projects(all off them of my own design) and competed in a programming Olympiad. I started with programming a raspberry pie in python, but I quickly discovered I didn't like coding sensors so i moved to making some fun apps in python, jump ahead 5 years and I decided to learn C, So I started making my first [operating system](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX), half way through I got board. A few months later I stumble across the code to AthenX and I decided to start working on it again. Now I am working on AthenX-2.0. A re-upload of AthenX but with a completely different kernel used as a base.  

# Description of the type of projects I do

I like to do projects that will challenge me and make me have to really think about how I am going to solve the problem. The project dose not have to be helpful, it just mustn't be easy.

# list projects here:
- [AthenX](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX) - A monotasking 32 bit operating system which is absolutely useless(Put logo here)
- [AthenX-2.0](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX-2.0) - A 32 bit operating system which is actually useful, it has the very basic functionality of a cli OS and looks pretty awesome(Put logo here)(put a picture here)
- [Winline](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/WinLine) - A substitute for Windows Command prompt that I keep forgetting I have

- There are other projects I am working on, but they are are private and I dont feel like uploading them.

# My Second OS Project
AthenX-2.0 is my main project and focus. It is a simple 32 bit operating system that build off [primus-os](https://github.com/araujo88/primus-o),[AthenX](https://github.com/KingVentrix007/AthenX), and [os](https://github.com/pritamzope/OS/tree/master), My goal is to have an open source operating system that runs on real hardwar, has a basic filesystem, network capability's, and some apps and games. Feel free to contribute to AthenX-2.0, please see the [Contributes](https://github.com/pritamzope/OS/tree/master) for more information about guidelines and [this]() to get a list of things you can contribute
