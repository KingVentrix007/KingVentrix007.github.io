# Welcome to my website

I am a part-time(trying for fulltime) programmer, software developer,operating system developer , and full time nerd.
I code C(link to c wiki), Python(Link to Python wiki), Assembly(Link to Assembly wiki) and javascript(Link to JavaScript wiki). Currently I am working on (number of projects) projects, but my main focus is AthenX(Link to AthenX repo), my hobby operating system. 

# About me

I have been coding since 2017, since then I have worked on some projects(all off them of my own design) and competed in a programming Olympiad. I started with programming a raspberry pie in python, but I quickly discovered I didn't like coding sensors so i moved to making some fun apps in python, jump ahead 5 years and I decided to learn C, So I started making my own first operating system(Link to athenX), half way through I got board. A few months later I stumble across the code to AthenX and I decided to start working on it again. Now I am working on AthenX-2.0(Link to athenX-2.0 repo). A re-upload of AthenX but with a completely different kernel used as a base.  

# Description of the type of projects I do

I like to do projects that will challenge me and make me have to really think about how I am going to solve the problem. The project dose not have to be helpful, it just mustn't be easy.

# list projects here: Links to there repositories

- AthenX(link to repo) - A monotasking 32 bit operating system which is absolutely useless(Put logo here)
- AthenX-2.0(link to repo) - A 32 bit operating system which is actually useful, it has the very basic functionality of a cli OS and looks pretty awesome(Put logo here)(put a picture here)
- Winline(link to repo) - A substitute for Windows Command prompt that I keep forgetting I have

- There are other projects I am working on, but they are are private and I dont feel like uploading them.

# My Second OS Project
AthenX-2.0 is my main project and focus. It is a simple 32 bit operating system that build of (primus-os),(athenX), and (os), My goal is to have an open source operating system that runs on real hardwar, has a basic filesystem, network capability's, and some apps and games. Feel free to contribute to AthenX-2.0, please see the Contributes(link to contribute) for more information about guidelines and This
